LIDAR-VISION: Door Edge Detection using LIDAR Sensors

Project Overview

This project leverages LIDAR sensors to detect door edges, enhancing the spatial awareness and navigational capabilities of autonomous vehicles. By integrating LIDAR perception with a custom edge detection algorithm, the system enables autonomous vehicles to identify and navigate through doorways with precision.

Key Features

LIDAR-Based Perception: Utilizes LIDAR sensors to scan and detect door edges in dynamic environments.

Edge Detection Algorithm: Processes LIDAR point clouds to accurately identify vertical surfaces and edges corresponding to doors.

Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time detection, allowing for seamless navigation through doorways.

Adaptability: Robust against different door shapes and environmental variations.

Real-World Applications

Autonomous Vehicles: Facilitates safe and efficient indoor and outdoor navigation by allowing autonomous vehicles to detect and pass through doorways.

Robotics: Enhances the perception abilities of service robots operating in environments with door-based access points.

Industrial Automation: Improves the mobility of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in warehouses and factories, enabling them to traverse doorways without manual intervention.
